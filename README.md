# Vityarthi_Project
Menstrual Cycle Prediction Tool

>Overview of the Project

This project is a simple Python-based tool for menstrual cycle prediction. It allows users to input previous period start (and end) dates, calculates the average length of cycles, and predicts the expected start date of the next period. The tool aims to support planning and raise awareness about menstrual health by forecasting future cycles using personal data.​

>Features
>
Track and store historical period start and end dates

Calculate individual cycle lengths and average cycle length

Predict the next period start date based on your history

Display all calculations and predictions clearly in the console

>Technologies/Tools Used

Python (3.x)

Standard Python libraries: datetime (no external dependencies)

>Steps to Install & Run the Project

Ensure you have Python 3 installed.

Download or clone the project files to your computer.

Open the terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

Edit the cycle_data list in the script to enter your own data, if desired.

Run the script using:

text                   -
python predict_period.py

View the recorded cycle lengths and predicted next period date printed in the console.

>Instructions for Testing

Use the default sample data in cycle_data to verify the calculations.

Add your own cycles (start and end dates) as Python date() objects in the cycle_data list to test predictions with personal history.

Run the program after each modification to see updated calculations and predictions.
